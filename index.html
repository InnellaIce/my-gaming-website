            <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2>

            </figure>
                <p>Tears of the Kingdom is the much anticipated sequel to Breath of The Wild. Many consider BOTW to be one of the best games of all time, so there was a very high bar set for the sequel. Much to my delight, TOTK surpassed its predecessor in almost every way.</p>
                <p>Every inch of this game is filled with new discoveries and a sense of creative freedom that I have never experienced before in a game. I gave this game over 100 hours of my time, and I would gladly give it 100 more. I give this game a resounding 10 out of 10.</p>

        <section id="VampireSurvivorsHeader">
            <h2>Vampire Survivors</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/VampireSurvivors.jpeg" alt="Vampire Survivors" title="Vampire Survivors Art" onmouseover="hoverOverVampireSurvivors(this);" onmouseout="hoverOutVampireSurvivors(this)">
            </figure>
                <p>Vampire Survivors is one of my biggest gaming surprises in recent memory. With 8-bit graphics and only four controls, this game is the definition of less is more, that is until the enemies start coming. Italian developer Luca Galante was formerly responsible for creating casino games so he is well-versed on how to create seratonin inducing sights and sounds that keep players coming back for more. I certainly fell victim to his methods and lost dozens of hours to this addicting monster-fest! This game gets a very unexpected 10 out of 10. </p>

        <section id="StarfieldHeader">
            <h2>Starfield</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Starfield.jpeg" alt="Starfield" title="Starfield Art" onmouseover="hoverOverStarfield(this);" onmouseout="hoverOutStarfield(this)">
            </figure>
                <p>It was virtually impossible for Starfield to exceed expectations. It's no secret that Xbox has been in dire need of some first-party titles to generate excitement from gamers. For years, Xbox has been touting Starfield as their next big thing.</p>
                <p>While Bethesda's newest title still suffers from the bugs that the studio has become notorious for, the game mostly delivers on its promises. It is a massive space exploration with an exciting story and tons of freedom. I give Starfield an 8 out of 10.</p>
